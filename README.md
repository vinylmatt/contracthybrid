Implement plan
effective robots at a local level that will chase down dirt and get the job done
need to handle their own emotional states
helpful, but not to the point of getting confused or getting in each other's way.
always one eye on performance - at robot level - first attempt to wakeup least productive robots. Selected because audction pattern pervide a platform for frobbing
second to guide them to good dirt - tah where the dirt is and chase it down preferentially.
Somewhat chaotic - there are iterations of tuning, there is space to catch emergent behaviours - one eye on performance at org level - what's being finished, what's reacting to changes like generate dust at a robot level. How does the system behave at both levels, the org and the local.
Affect the choices of the other robots by supplying them with certain learned info - dead ends to avoid and if time and stability - allows dust on the table, reducing the search space from what the agent can know.


testing techniques - dense logging and speeded up footage
